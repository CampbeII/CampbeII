# Alexander Campbell
I love solving complex problems with computer code. When i'm not hacking away at something, i'm out kayaking. 

## Create.Marketing Platform
I've been hard at work developing an "all-in-one" marketing platform. Create.Marketing is intended to be an online marketing department at your fingertips. I am currently in the process of migrating my code to GitHub and determining what I wish to share, and what I don't.

## Tutorials
When learning a new subject or language I like to write tutorials for myself. This not only helps me understand,  but gives me something to reference later that is writen in a way I can understand. Whether or not it makes sense to anyone else is debatable.

**Warning:** 
Some tutorials might be incomplete. Life gets in the way sometimes, and I need to stop learning cool things, in order to make money, to afford the time...to keep learning cool things.
